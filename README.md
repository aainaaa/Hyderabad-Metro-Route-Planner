#  Metro Shortest Path Finder (Dijkstra Algorithm)

This project implements **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to compute the shortest path in a metro-style graph. The graph structure is defined through a **JSON configuration file**, and the project includes optional **graph visualization** and a **Streamlit UI** for interactive exploration.

##  Features

- Computes shortest path using Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
- Reads graph from a JSON file  
- Visualizes the metro graph using NetworkX  
- Optional Streamlit interface  
- Clean, extensible project structure
